# LTW Project

On this project, we developed a ticketing system that uses PHP, JS and of course, HTML.
It supports multiple roles, role and user management and the creation of a ticket (github issues style).

Grade: 19.1

For future students:

- There some things implemented right, like the REST api is implemented with a custom wrapper that simplifies the process.
- The database and logic is coherent, but maybe the implementation of a mini-ORM could actually simplify the project.
- The javascript needs refactoring to make the project cleaner in the frontend side (and not to use var).
